### Just a simple program to calculate the time you spend in call with someone
1. Export the Discord chat you want to analyze using [DiscordChatExporter]([https://](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter))
2. Open terminal at python file location
3. Run the command ``python main.py``. (Or ``python3 main.py`` if doesn't work)
4. Enter the file path to your HTML Discord chat log file when prompted. *(Example: F:\1- SAVE\file.html)*
   
    **Note:** Do not include quotation marks around the file path
