# Discord Call Duration Calculator
### Just a simple program to calculate the time you spend in call with someone
1. Export the Discord chat you want to analyze using [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter).
3. Open a terminal at the location of the Python file.
4. Install the dependencies by running the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
5. Run the ``main.py``file.
6. Enter the file path to your HTML Discord chat log file when prompted. *(Example: F:\1- SAVE\file.html)*
   
    **Note:** Do not include quotation marks around the file path.
7. Press Enter, the script will analyze the file, calculate the total call duration, and display the result. An image in PNG format will be created with your data.
